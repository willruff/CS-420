## Python

In Python I used a for loop with the range command to iterate through 1-100. Inside of the loop I used an if, else if, else logic to first check if the value was both mod 3 and 5. From there it went through the checks ending with the number being printed if none of the checks for divisibilty of 3 or 5 were met.

To Run: "python FizzBuzz.py"

## JavaScript

The JavaScript implementation was almost exactly the same as the python implementation. For the loop I set the "i" value to 1 and increased it until it hit 101. The if else logic I used in JavaScript was identical to the logic in python. The only difference was instead of printing the result I used console.log. I also had to actually call the function I put the logic in.

To Run: "node FizzBuzz.js"

## Java

The Java implementation was identical for the actual logic part of executing the FizzBuzz program. The only things different with the Java implementation was that I put it in the main Java method which is automatically called at runtime. Also instead of console.log I now used System.out.println.

To Run: "Java FizzBuzz.java"

## C#

The C# implementation was basically identical to the java implementation. The logic was all the same I just also had to add a namespace. The print was also now Console.WriteLine.

For C# you must properly set up the .NET SDK and use a .csproj file in order to compile and execute the program.

To Run: "dotnet run"

## Racket

The implementation for Racket was a bit different than the other ones. The for loop was basically the same as all the other programs with i iterating through a range. I used the cond statement in Racket to kind of act like an else if branch of checks. The actual logic of the conditions were the same as all of the other programs. I also used displayln with format to always print the value as a string.

To Run: "racket FizzBuzz.rkt"

## C

The C implementation was identical to the C# implementation other than the format of the printing. I used printf in C to format my output. Other than that the logic was all the same.

For C you must compile the file first. I used the command "gcc FizzBuzz.c -o FizzBuzz" to compile my program.

To Run: "./FizzBuzz"
